### Guidelines on scheduling your subscriber list:

---

Any schedule has 3 required parameters:

1. Name of the subscriber list to schedule (select) - please select one of the subscriber lists names to schedule
2. On (input) - on which day of the month you want the subscriber list to fire. The default is 28th. Please avoid setting it more than 28 as it will make the scheduler not fire on months where there are less days than set.
3. Timeout (input) - how long the scheduler should wait for the subscriber list to fire before interrupting the job in seconds. The default is 5 minutes. Please increase that value if you are having problems with subscriber list not firing.
